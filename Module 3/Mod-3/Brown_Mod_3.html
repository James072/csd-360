    <p>
      One of the events that sparked the custody battle for my son was when my son's
      mother did not return him from a scheduled visit.  She was also supposed to take
      him to an appointment with the therapist, but <span id="show">_______________________</span>
      also.  The next morning, I received a call from the CPS worker, who was called by
      the therapist.  The CPS worker informed me that I needed to <span id="make">_______________________</span>
      by noon, or all of her kids, including mine, would be taken into state custody.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about five minutes past noon whe the judge signed off on my emergency order
      for temporary custody.  I immediately called the CPS worker to get her to call off 
      the removal of the kids.  Then, I headed straight to my son's mother's house to 
      retrieve my son, and just in case there was drama, <span id="asked">_______________________</span>
      to meet me there.  Regardless to the police presence, a big commotion was started,
      which distracted everyone from the fact that my son's mother and her friend <span id="sneak">_________________________</span>.  
      I ended up getting him back the next day.
